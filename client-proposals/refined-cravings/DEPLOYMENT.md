- Honeypot spam protection included

2. Add email notification:
   - **Event**: New form submission
   - **Email**: your-email@domain.com
   - **Subject**: New Refined Cravings Booking Request

### 3. Custom Domain (Optional)

### 4. Testing
After deployment:
- âœ… Test form submission (check Netlify dashboard for entries)

## Troubleshooting

### Form Issues:
- Ensure form has `netlify` attribute
- Check form name matches hidden field value
- Verify honeypot field is included

### Routing Issues:
- Product pages should work with included `netlify.toml`
- If 404 errors occur, check file paths in repository

### Cart Issues:
- Cart uses localStorage - works offline
- JavaScript should load properly with included configuration

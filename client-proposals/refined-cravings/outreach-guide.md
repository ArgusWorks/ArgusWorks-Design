# Refined Cravings - Client Outreach Script

## Initial Contact Strategy

### In-Person Visit Approach
**Best Time**: Mid-morning (10-11 AM) or mid-afternoon (2-3 PM) when they're less busy

**Opening Script:**
"Hi! I'm [Your Name], a local web designer who specializes in helping premium food businesses like yours grow online. I was checking out your Instagram - your charcuterie boards are absolutely stunning! I noticed your current website might not be doing justice to the beautiful work you create. Could I show you a quick example of what a modern website could do for your business? It'll just take 2 minutes."

### Phone Outreach Script
"Hi, is this [Owner Name] from Refined Cravings? Hi, this is [Your Name]. I'm a local web designer and I've been admiring your work on Instagram - your charcuterie boards are incredible! I specialize in helping premium catering businesses like yours attract more high-end clients through modern website design. 

I took a look at your current website and I think there's a huge opportunity to better showcase your premium brand and potentially increase your bookings by 25-40%. Would you be open to a 15-minute conversation about what that might look like for your business?"

### Email Outreach Template

**Subject**: Quick question about your Refined Cravings website

Hi [Owner Name],

I came across Refined Cravings on Instagram and I'm blown away by your artistry! Your charcuterie boards are absolutely gorgeous - you clearly know how to create premium experiences.

I'm a local web designer who specializes in helping food businesses like yours, and I noticed your current website might not be showcasing your premium brand as effectively as it could be.

I actually created a mockup of what a modern website could look like for Refined Cravings (attached). The goal would be to:
- Better reflect your premium positioning
- Make it easier for clients to book consultations
- Showcase your stunning work more effectively
- Improve mobile experience (70% of visitors browse on phones)

Similar businesses typically see 25-40% more qualified inquiries after a website redesign.

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call this week to discuss how this could help grow your business? I'm happy to share more examples and answer any questions.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Phone]
[Your Website]

P.S. I noticed you serve the Inland Empire, Orange County, and LA County - I'm based locally in [Your City] so I understand the market well.

## Objection Handling

### "We're happy with our current website"
**Response**: "That's great to hear! I'm sure it's been working for you. I'm curious though - are you finding that most of your new clients are coming through referrals, or are you getting a good number of inquiries directly from the website? The reason I ask is that with your premium positioning, there might be an opportunity to attract even more high-end clients who are searching online."

### "We don't have the budget right now"
**Response**: "I totally understand - and that's exactly why this could be valuable. If your current website is missing even one high-end wedding booking per month, that could be $1,000+ in lost revenue. The investment for a professional website redesign is $2,200, so it typically pays for itself with just 2-3 additional bookings. Would it make sense to at least explore what those numbers might look like for your business?"

### "We just renewed our Wix subscription"
**Response**: "No problem at all - we can work around any existing commitments. The bigger question is whether your current setup is really serving your premium brand. Wix is great for getting started, but when you're competing for high-end weddings and corporate events, the professionalism of your website really matters. What if we could show you a side-by-side comparison of what a custom solution could do for your business?"

### "We need to think about it"
**Response**: "Absolutely - this is an important decision for your business. What specific questions do you have that would help you move forward? I'm happy to put together some numbers showing what a 25% increase in qualified inquiries could mean for your revenue. Would that be helpful?"

### "We get most of our business from referrals"
**Response**: "That's fantastic - referrals are the best kind of business! And that tells me you're delivering exceptional service. The thing is, even referred clients often check out your website before booking to make sure you're professional and legitimate. Plus, when someone refers you, wouldn't it be great if that person could just send them to a beautiful website that showcases your work instead of having to explain everything? It makes the referral process much easier for your advocates."

## Follow-Up Strategy

### After Initial Contact
**Within 24 hours**: Send thank you email with:
- Link to mockup website
- Case study from similar business
- Calendar link for consultation

### If No Response After 1 Week
**Follow-up email**:
"Hi [Name], I wanted to follow up on the website mockup I shared for Refined Cravings. I know you're busy running your business, so I'll keep this brief.

I'm genuinely excited about the potential I see for your business online. Your work is stunning, and with the right website, I believe you could attract significantly more premium clients.

If the timing isn't right now, I completely understand. But if you'd like to explore what a 25-40% increase in qualified inquiries could mean for your business, I'm happy to put together some specific projections.

Either way, I wish you continued success with Refined Cravings!"

### If Interested But Hesitant
**Offer risk reduction**:
- "Let's start with just a consultation - no commitment"
- "I can show you examples from 3 other catering businesses I've helped"
- "We can break the investment into smaller payments if that helps"

## Closing Techniques

### The Consultation Close

### The Urgency Close

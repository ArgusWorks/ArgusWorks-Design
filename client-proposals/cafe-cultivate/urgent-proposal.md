**Investment**: $1,800 (Rush Launch Special)

## ‚è∞ **Why You Need This TODAY**

### **Grand Opening Challenges Without a Website:**

**Lost Discovery Opportunities**
- People Google "new cafe Redlands" and find nothing
- Potential customers can't find your menu, hours, or location
- Social media followers have nowhere to get detailed info

**Credibility Issues**  
- Modern customers expect businesses to have websites
- "Are they even legitimate?" - common customer concern
- Competitors with websites appear more established

**Missed Revenue**
- No online menu = customers don't know what you offer
- No contact info = can't call for catering inquiries  
- No hours posted = people don't know when you're open

### **The October Launch Window**
- **Holiday season approaching** - prime time for coffee shops
- **Back-to-school crowd** looking for new study spots
- **Holiday catering inquiries** starting now
- **First impressions matter most** in opening months

## üéØ **What You're Missing Every Day**

### **Real Impact Numbers:**

**Daily Lost Opportunities:**
- 20-50 people Google local cafes daily in Redlands
- 70% of those expect to find website/menu online
- Without a website, you're invisible to 15-35 potential customers per day

**Weekly Revenue Impact:**
- Average coffee shop customer: $8-15 per visit
- Lost daily customers: 25 (conservative estimate)
- Daily lost revenue: $200-375
- **Weekly lost revenue: $1,400-2,625**

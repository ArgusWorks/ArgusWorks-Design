**Outreach Process:**
1. **Drive/walk around your area** and note businesses with:
   - No website at all

2. **Research each business:**
   - Check if they have a website
   - Look at their Google My Business listing

   - Note their competitors' websites

3. **Visit in person** (most effective):
   - Dress professionally
   - Bring printed examples of your work
   - Ask to speak with the owner/manager
   - Offer a free website audit

- Compare to other marketing costs: "This costs less than 3 months of Yellow Pages ads"

**"I don't have time"**
- "That's exactly why you need this - we handle everything"
- "We work around your schedule - evenings and weekends available"
- "The busier you are, the more you need customers to find you online"

**"I'll think about it"**
- Create urgency: "I can lock in this special price if we start this week"
- Risk reversal: "Let's start with the audit - no commitment required"
- Social proof: "I just finished a similar project for [similar business] down the street"

### Closing Techniques

**The Assumption Close:**
"Great! When would you like to get started? I have availability next week or the week after."

**The Alternative Close:**
"Would you prefer the Business package with 5 pages, or should we start with the Starter package?"

**The Urgency Close:**
"I'm booking projects 3 weeks out, but I had a cancellation for next week. If you want to move forward, I can fit you in."

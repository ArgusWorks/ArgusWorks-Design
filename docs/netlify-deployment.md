## ðŸ’¼ **Client Website Deployment Process**

### **Method 1: Separate Netlify Sites (Recommended for Clients)**

**For each client (like Refined Cravings):**

1. **Create separate GitHub repo:**
```bash
# Create new folder for client
mkdir refined-cravings-website
cd refined-cravings-website

# Copy client files
cp -r ../LocalBusinessNetlifyApp/client-proposals/refined-cravings/* .
cp ../LocalBusinessNetlifyApp/assets/ ./assets/ -r
cp ../LocalBusinessNetlifyApp/package.json .
cp ../LocalBusinessNetlifyApp/vite.config.js .
cp ../LocalBusinessNetlifyApp/netlify.toml .

# Initialize git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial Refined Cravings website"
```

2. **Push to separate GitHub repo:**
   - Create new repo: "refined-cravings-website"  
   - Push code to new repo

3. **Deploy to separate Netlify site:**
   - Create new Netlify site from the client's repo
   - Client gets their own: `refinedcravings.netlify.app`
   - Can add client's custom domain: `refinedcravings.com`

### **Method 2: Subdirectories (For Proposals/Demos)**

Keep all proposals in main repo under `/client-proposals/` for easy demonstration during sales process.

## ðŸ“§ **Netlify Forms Setup (Critical for Lead Generation)**

### **How It Works:**
Netlify automatically handles form submissions when you add `netlify` attribute to forms.

Your forms already have the correct setup:
```html
<form name="contact" method="POST" netlify>
  <input type="hidden" name="form-name" value="contact">
  <!-- form fields -->
</form>
```

### **Accessing Form Submissions:**
1. **In Netlify Dashboard:** Site â†’ Forms
2. **View submissions** for each form
3. **Set up notifications:** Email alerts when forms are submitted
4. **Export data:** Download CSV of all submissions

### **Form Notifications Setup:**
1. **Go to:** Site Settings â†’ Forms â†’ Form notifications
2. **Add notification:** Email to your address
3. **Customize:** Get instant alerts when clients submit inquiries

## ðŸ”„ **Development Workflow**

### **For Template Updates:**
```bash
# Make changes to templates
git add .
git commit -m "Update template styling"
git push

```

### **For New Client Projects:**
```bash
# Create new branch for client proposal
git checkout -b proposal/cafe-cultivate
# Make client-specific changes
git add .
git commit -m "Cafe Cultivate proposal"
git push origin proposal/cafe-cultivate

# Netlify creates preview URL: proposal-cafe-cultivate--yoursite.netlify.app
```

### **For Client Revisions:**

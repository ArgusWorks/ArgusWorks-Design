# Client Delivery Workflow - Web Design Business

## Overview
This document outlines the professional process for delivering client websites from mock-up to final deployment.

## Delivery Strategy: Portfolio + Individual Deployments

### Phase 1: Portfolio Site (This Repository)
**Purpose**: Marketing, portfolio showcase, lead generation
**URL Structure**: `yourportfolio.netlify.app/demos/client-name`
**Use For**:
- Initial client presentations
- Portfolio demonstrations
- SEO and marketing
- Template showcases

### Phase 2: Individual Client Sites
**Purpose**: Professional client delivery with custom branding
**URL Structure**: `clientname.netlify.app` or `client-custom-domain.com`
**Use For**:
- Final client deliverables
- Client-specific customization
- Independent management
- Professional presentation

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Initial Client Presentation
```
Portfolio Site Demo â†’ Client Approval â†’ Custom Deployment
```

**Process**:
1. Show client their mock-up on your portfolio site
2. Use URL: `yoursite.netlify.app/client-proposals/refined-cravings/`
3. Client reviews and approves design
4. Move to individual deployment phase

### 2. Individual Client Deployment

#### Option A: Separate Repository (Recommended)
```bash
# Create new repository for client
gh repo create refined-cravings-website --private
git clone https://github.com/youraccount/refined-cravings-website.git
cp -r client-proposals/refined-cravings/* refined-cravings-website/
cd refined-cravings-website
git add . && git commit -m "Initial client website"
git push origin main
```

#### Option B: Netlify Branch Deploy
```bash
# Create client-specific branch
git checkout -b client/refined-cravings
# Move client files to root
cp client-proposals/refined-cravings/* ./
git add . && git commit -m "Refined Cravings client site"
git push origin client/refined-cravings
```

### 3. Netlify Deployment Setup

#### For Separate Repository:
1. Connect new repo to Netlify
2. Build settings: `npm run build`
3. Publish directory: `dist`
4. Custom domain: `refinedcravings.com`

#### For Branch Deploy:
1. In Netlify dashboard: Site Settings â†’ Build & Deploy
2. Create new site from branch: `client/refined-cravings`
3. Set custom domain: `refinedcravings.netlify.app`
